				Hello I'm 32 years old, and I graduated from ITT-tech for Computer Electronics and Engineering Technology in 2005.  I worked as a Teachers Aid in computer programing both years I was in school.  The class was mainly Visual Basic which I had previous experience in High School.  I went to work Immediately after graduation for National Instruments in their Research And Development team.  I worked on Pxi/Vxi/Rio controllers mainly.  I left NI in 2007 due to medical problems I had to move back to Kansas from Austin, Tx.  After recovery I slowly started doing electronic repair work and Network repair for local businesses when I was healthy enough.  So I started my own little side business called Walton Electronics.

				I Have been doing the In home electronic repair ever since while raising my children Leo(9), Rio(5), and Kia(3mo).  In my spare time I have been learning new technologies and circuit designs.  I have also started learning App Development using X-code through a Udemy class.  I haven't finished it yet, but I have really enjoyed it.  I'm hoping to learn Swift and Python while or shortly after going through this program.
